## Collaboration Guidelines

__Anyone__ is welcome to collaborate on express and related projects (jshttp / pillarjs / etc).

We aim to be a community in which anyone can participate regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).Â­


## Issues

Please attempt to search for existing issues before filing a new one.

When creating an issue, try to clearly state how to reproduce the issue, and provide example code if possible. Doing so helps us help __you__! :)

We will gladly answer questions via GitHub, but you can also contact us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/), or freenode IRC (#express, #jshttp).
If you do not feel comfortable contacting us in public, you may email us under any email listed on our public GitHub profiles ([@Fishrock123](https://github.com/Fishrock123), [@dougwilson](https://github.com/dougwilson)).


## Code Contributions

Try to provide tests when you can; following our concise [style gude](https://github.com/jshttp/style-guide) also helps us.

However, we don't usually require that you do these things. Doing so only helps us help you get your contributions in.
We regularly patch up things such as style nits in commits so that new contributors don't have to worry about those.


## Code of Conduct

[This is why.](https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/codes-of-conduct-82ab2d88112d)

Until we have an official Code of Conduct, we will act against harassment according to any of the following codes as we best see fit to resolve the situation and bring safety to our community:

- [Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/)
- [Contributor Covenant](https://github.com/Bantik/contributor_covenant/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

tl;dr: Be respectful. Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
